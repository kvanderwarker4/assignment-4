                <br>- Walt Disney</h2>
            <p class="p-style"> As a highschool graduation present, my aunt took me to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and her twin sister, my mom, tagged along with us. Although I graduated in 2015, busy schedules forced us to postpone the trip until the next year, 2016. We were there from May 19th to May 23rd. My mom and I hadn't been to Disney World since I was in second grade, and it had been even longer for my aunt. This trip was so fun, it's still on our minds almost two years later! <br> <img src="images/MomAuntandMe.JPG" alt="My mom, aunt, and I in front of the castle" height="500"></p>
